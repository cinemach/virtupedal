# virtupedal
VIRTUpedAL is a 4th year IXD Thesis project and an in-dev tool for VTubing

This application is coded with VTS-Sharp Written by Tom Farro (https://www.twitter.com/fomtarro)
In it's current state it only functions for VTS (https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio)

!! CURRENTLY IT WILL ONLY TRIGGER IF THE EXPRESSION IS "shock" BECAUSE I ONLY HAVE TIME TO HARD CODE IT IN LIKE THAT !!
